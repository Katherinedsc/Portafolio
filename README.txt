**Introduction**

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a data analyst with expertise in data visualization and programming. This portfolio showcases my work in various data-driven projects that I have completed using Tableau, Python, R, and other tools.

Projects

## Project 1: Identifying Car Types by Fuel Type in Ireland- Dashboard
This project involved creating a sales analysis dashboard using Tableau. I collaborated with another person to create a graphic in Tableau that identifies the types of cars that are in Ireland by type of fuel. We used a dataset of car registrations in Ireland over the past five years and analyzed it using Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that shows the breakdown of car types by fuel type. Our goal was to help policymakers and researchers understand the current state of the Irish car market and its impact on the environment.

To create this project, I used Tableau to:

- Connect to the car registration dataset
- Clean and transform the data
- Create visualizations that show the breakdown of car types by fuel type
- Publish the interactive dashboard on Tableau Public

Overall, this project allowed us to showcase our data analysis and visualization skills using Tableau, and demonstrate our ability to work collaboratively on complex projects.


## Project 2: Analyzing the Titanic Dataset Using Python
For this project, I analyzed the Titanic dataset using Python. The goal was to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates among passengers on the Titanic. I used a variety of techniques in Python to explore the data, including:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model building and evaluation

Specifically, I:

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and categorical variables
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of variables and identify patterns and trends in the data
- Created new features, such as family size and title, to improve the accuracy of the predictive model
- Built and evaluated several machine learning models, including logistic regression and random forest, to predict survival rates

Throughout this project, I demonstrated my ability to work with data in Python and apply a range of analytical techniques to gain insights and make predictions.

## Project 3:  Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews Using R
I performed a sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews using R for this project. The goal was to understand the overall sentiment of customers towards a specific product and identify areas for improvement. I collected a dataset of Amazon reviews for the product and used R to analyze the text and sentiment of the reviews.

To complete this project, I used R to:

- Preprocess the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant information
- Create a corpus of the text data and transform it into a term-document matrix
- Conduct a sentiment analysis using the sentimentr package in R to assign positive, negative, or neutral scores to each review
- Create visualizations to show the distribution of sentiment scores and identify common themes and issues mentioned in the reviews

Overall, this project allowed me to showcase my data analysis skills using R, and demonstrate my ability to use sentiment analysis to gain insights into customer feedback.
