**Introduction**

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a data analyst with expertise in data visualization and predictive modeling. This portfolio showcases my work in various data-driven projects that I have completed using Tableau, Python, R, and other tools.

# Projects

Project 1: Sales Analysis Dashboard
This project involved creating a sales analysis dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the company's sales data and helps identify key trends and insights. I used Tableau to create interactive visualizations and charts that allowed users to explore the data in a meaningful way.

## Project 2: Predictive Modeling with Python
In this project, I used Python to develop a predictive model for customer churn. I used data from a telecommunications company to train and test the model, which achieved an accuracy of over 85%. I also created visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to help communicate the results of the model.

## Project 3: Data Cleaning and Analysis with R
In this project, I used R to clean and analyze a large dataset of weather data. I used dplyr and tidyr to clean and manipulate the data and ggplot2 to create visualizations that helped identify patterns and trends in the data.
